To monitor the system performance and understand what’s going on, there is a default tool called top

Go to your terminal and run:

```
$ top
```

the output, which will look like this:

top

This shows you the basic system status, the number of processes, and so on.

But there is a better version of this tool: **btop**.

Let’s first install it.

On Mac:

```
$ brew install btop
```

On Linux:

```
$ brew install btop
```

After the command is successful run:

```
$ btop
```

And you will see the following output:

btop

How cool is that?

But wait a minute. This is not just beautiful. This is functional as well.

You will see the shortcuts are given. You can use your mouse or keyboard to navigate and kill unnecessary processes.
